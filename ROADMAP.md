# Roadmap

This document describes the projected roadmap for the project after the publication of v2 (July 2024).

## July-August 2024

- Automate compilation of standalone versions in GitHub Action; enable release of a MacOS version of the application.
- Bug fixes and minor improvements to the application.

## Fall 2024

- Add new statistical methods for thematic cartography (notably PCA + hierarchical clustering).
- Enable map rendering on an HTML Canvas element to improve overall application performance when large datasets are added.
- Explore the possibility of adding geocoding functionality to tabular datasets.

## Winter 2024

- Explore the support of raster datasets (this implies deciding how to render these datasets "by default" but also proposing representation and analysis functionalities dedicated to this new type of data).
- Explore support for tiled raster background maps (such as OpenStreetMap tiles).
