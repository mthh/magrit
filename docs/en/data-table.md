## Data export to CSV

You can export the data table displayed in CSV format by clicking on the "Export to CSV..." button at the bottom left of the table.
With this type of export, entity geometry is not exported (if you require an export type that includes geometry,
you can use the "Export" function in the left-hand menu).
