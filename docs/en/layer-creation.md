It is possible to create a new representation from a layer of geographic data or from a data table.

The available features depend on the type of data (geographic or tabular) selected
and the type of variables contained (stock, ratio, etc.) in the data.

The grayed-out features indicate that the option is not available for the data contained in the layer in question.
If you think the option should be available, check that the data is correctly typed (see [Field typing](./typing)).

After choosing the type of representation, it is necessary to choose the various parameters
specific to the chosen representation (for example, the field to represent, the type of discretization, etc.).
