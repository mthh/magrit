The user interface is divided into three main parts:

- **The menu bar**: located at the top of the interface, it allows access to several "general" features of the application (language change, opening / saving a project, access to the documentation, etc.).
- **The left side menu**: it allows navigation between the different steps of creating a map (importing data, choosing a map projection, creating different representations, exporting the created map, etc.)
- **The central area**: this is where the user can view their map and interact with it.

Each step of creating a map is represented by a tab in the left side menu.
The user can navigate between these tabs to return to a previous step or move on to the next step.

::: tip Tip

The various clickable buttons in the interface display a tooltip when hovered over with the mouse.

Use these tooltips to familiarize yourself with the application's various functions.
