The map configuration panel allows you to modify the parameters related to the dimensions of the map:
- the size of the map in pixels (width and height),
- whether to lock or not the zoom / pan behavior of the map,
- the presence or not of margins (and, if applicable, the color and opacity of these margins - these options are only displayed if a margin has been specified).

::: tip Tip
If you wish, it is also possible to resize the map by selecting one of its sides or one of its corners
and moving it to the desired position to achieve the desired width and/or height.
