# Layout and design elements of the map

This section describes the different layout and design elements that can be used to create a map with Magrit:
title, source, north arrow, scale, images, etc.

<ZoomImg
    src="/layout-features.png"
    alt="Layout and design elements of the map"
    caption="Layout and design elements of the map"
/>

The "title" and "source" fields allow you to respectively enter the title of the map and its sources.
Note, however, that this is only a shortcut to creating a free text element, already placed
in the right place on the map (top center for the title and bottom left for the source) - it is possible to
manually move these elements, like the other layout elements.
