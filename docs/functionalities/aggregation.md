# Agr√©gation

This feature allows you to merge geographic entities into larger ones.

This operation is useful for aggregating geographical data on a larger scale than that of the initial data.

You can :

- choose a grouping field (for example, the name of a department) ;
- choose to aggregate all entities in the layer.

## Examples
